function [f,P,sgf,sigma] = lombscargle(x,y,ofac,fmax)

% LOMBSCARGLE computes the power spectral density of a given
% one-dimensional dataset that is unevenly sampled using the Lomb-Scargle
% algorithm. This algorithm is explained thoroughly in the references given
% below. Most of the variable names have been retained as given in Press et
% al. (2007), but this implementation is a vectorized direct implementation
% of the formulas given there.

%
% INPUT
% x     -   sampling points.
% y     -   observed data. This can be a column vector or a matrix. If it
%           is a matrix then the operations are performed column-wise.
% ofac  -   scaling factor that decides the spacing for the frequency
%           search.
% fmax  -   highest frequency (not angular) that needs to be searched for.
%           If no input is given then Nyquist frequency is chosen as the
%           'fmax'. This must have same units as the sampling points.
%
% OUTPUT
% f     -   vector of frequencies whose power was computed.
% P     -   estimated power of the frequencies in 'f'. P has the same 
%           number of columns as the observed dataset 'y'.
% sgf   -   significance of the power of the each of the estimated
%           frequencies 'f'.
% sigma -   computed satndard deviation of the dataset 'y'.
